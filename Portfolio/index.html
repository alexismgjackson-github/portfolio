        <p>
          I'm a self-taught
          <span class="highlight">Frontend Developer</span> focused on creating
          engaging and accessible web experiences. My passion for
          <span class="highlight">UI design</span> and background in
          <span class="highlight">customer service</span> are my superpowers.
          When I'm not at my laptop, I am probably listening to music, reading a
          book, watching movies or window shopping.
