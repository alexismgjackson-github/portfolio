        <h2>01. About</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught
          <span class="highlight">Frontend Developer</span> focused on creating
          engaging web experiences. My extensive background in customer service
          is my superpower. When I'm not at my laptop, I am probably listening
          to experimental music, reading a sci-fi book, watching an anime or
          cooking something in an airfryer.
