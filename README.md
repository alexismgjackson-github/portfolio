# _PORTFOLIO - PERSONAL WEBSITE_

Portfolio is a fully responsive site showcases my projects and experience.

## FEATURES

- Theme Mode Toggle Switch

## TECHNOLOGIES

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- LocalStorage
- Coolors Color Tool
- Google Fonts & Icons

## WHY I BUILT THIS

This is the first portfolio site. My goal was to give it a minimalistic yet sleek UI design. Also, I wanted to give the user the ability to toggle the site's theme mode.

## WHAT I LEARNED

### _EXPORTING/IMPORTING DATA_

- Using named imports and setting type="module" in the script tag
- Using forEach to iterate over the array of objects

### _LOCALSTORAGE_

- Setting, getting and persisting the theme mode in LocalStorage when user checks the toggle switch

### _RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN_

- Implementing media queries to add device breakpoints
- Using device breakpoints to change orientation, font size, etc
- Using CSS Position, Grid and Flexbox

### _ACCESSIBILITY_

- Calculating the contrast ratio of text, icons and background colors using Coolors' Color Contrast Checker
- Adding aria-labels and alt tags to buttons, icons, images, etc

## MOST CHALLENGING

- Building the theme mode toggle switch

## BUGS

- I have not found any bugs for this project yet

## FUTURE UPDATES

- Convert app from JavaScript to React
